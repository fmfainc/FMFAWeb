                        <p>According to the creators of Scrum, Scrum is:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lightweight</li>
                                <li>Simple to understand</li>

                            </ul>
                        <p>In other words, adopting the Scrum framework promises breathtaking benefits, but ONLY if implemented properly</p>
